# Example project for UE4 OpenID Client

This is a project that demonstrates the capabilities of the UE4 OpenID Client

## To Run

This example requires an OpenID provider server, I already have one set up but it requires docker:
  1. Download and install docker: https://www.docker.com/
  2. In terminal run: `docker pull taigi100/ue4_openid_client_example`
  3. In terminal run: `docker run -p 8080:8080 taigi100/ue4_openid_client_example`
  
To run the project, just open it with UE4 and press play!

You can use the following user for testing:

    Username: test
    Password: test
 
Note: This example requires you to use the plugin bought from the marketplace!
